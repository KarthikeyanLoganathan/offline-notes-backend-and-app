Help me develop a Notes Android Application with offline capabilities.  

Backend User Management already developed tested.
User will be able to self-register himself with first name, last name, address details, notes.  User gets email with a generated code.  User confirms the email.  Account gets created successfully.  This requires suitable user database table.  User session shall be tracked by a separate table for users signed in from their devices.  Should user cookie map to the session?  Suggest best possible solution there.
Develop suitable databse and service backend layer for this.

Backend Notes Database already developed and tested. 
Logged user shall be able to maintain notes in the database - tracked by creation date, time, last change date time.
The notes database also shall have appropriate labels concept to be able to attach multiple lables to a given note.
Develop suitable database and service backend layer for this.
Notes API shall support getlist (global) sorted by last changed time - restricted to login user.
Notes API shall support getlist (label) sorted by last changed time - restricted to login user.
User specifc last change timestamp across the notes (global) shall be stored in DB.  This acts as basis for on-demand refresh in front end.
User specific last change timestamp across the notes of the given list shall be stored in DB. This acts as basis for on-demand refresh in front end.
It shall be possible to search across notes.
Deleted Notes shall be kept in special list (Deleted) for configurable period of time like 3 months.


Android Mobile App is in folder frontend/android.  But it does not start:
The application shall use SQLite for offline caching.
Login session shall be remebered in the SQLite DB.
Notes shall be cached in the SQLite DB.
The Local Data model shall be shadow of Notes Database in backend.  Local DB shall keep sync-status on individual note, global list, individual label level.
It shall be possible to search across notes.

Adjust the mobile app with the following capabilities.
1. User Self-Service registration
2. User Login
2. Notes View (global) with search capability
3. Notes View (label) with search capability
4. Create New Note shall be possible 
5. Edit Note shall be possible.
6. Delete Note shall be possible.
7. It shall be possible to attach notes to labels


Note the backend is fine.
